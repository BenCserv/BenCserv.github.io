    Hi Everyone!

    I'm excited to be your classmates this summer as we get into web design and development. 
    Currently, I work up in the Chicagoland area and graduated from the University of Missouri this past May. 
    I graduated with a Business Administration major. I love being outside and doing things like biking, kayaking, hiking. 
    I am also into nutrition and fitness, and enjoy being a musician in my spare time.
    
    I have coding and programming background skills and a little bit of web development skills that I have gained through my classes at the University of Missouri. 
    I hope to learn from this class how to scale a website and build/develop it from the ground-up. 
    Eventually, I want to use these skills to create my own websites and better understand web development for my future.
