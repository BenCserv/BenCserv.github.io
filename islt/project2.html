                            <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
                            1.Begin to boil water and at the same time, turn on medium-high heat for your skillet. While the water is boiling, fill the skillet with olive oil till the pan is covered. 
                    
                    2. From there we are going to thinly slice the scallions and let them dissipate into the olive oil at medium-high temperature.
                    
                    3. Enter noodles into pot of boiling water and occasionally stir and add salt. At the same time enter your 2 cans of tomato paste into the skillet and stir it at a slow tempo to make sure it breaks down.
                    
                    4. During this time we should be checking the noodles, which when ready, should be soft. (Try lifting one out and pushing on it with a finger, if its soft and moves very easily without breaking, it's complete). Transfer the noodles to a strainer, while doing that, take 1&1/2 cups of the boiling pasta water per can of tomato paste used, and pour it into your tomato paste, and stir.
                    
                    5. As the noodles are sitting, enter in 3 teaspoons of vodka. A cup of heavy whipping cream, 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, half a cup of crushed red pepper, and 4 teaspoons of salt into your sauce.
                    
                    6. Turn the sauce pan on low heat and continue to stir, it should be a nice autumn orange color. Put the noodles back in your emptied pot on low heat, add half a cup of olive oil, and two tablespoons of butter. Stir until all the noodles are covered. Add the salt and Italian seasoning to the noodles and stir till its distributed evenly. 
                    
                    7. Now, you may add the sauce and noodles together, layer it over with the shredded parmesan and crushed basil, to complete yourSpicy Penne Vodka dish.
